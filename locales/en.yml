        Parallels DHCP leases file is not accessible. The Parallels provider
        uses it to detect an IP address of virtual machine. This file must be
        readable for the user that is running Vagrant.

        There was an error while command execution. The command and stderr is shown below.

      linux_mount_failed: |-
        Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. This is usually because
        the "prl_fs" file system is not available. Please verify that
        Parallels Tools are properly installed in the guest and
        can work properly. If so, the VM reboot can solve a problem.

      parallels_install_incomplete: |-
        Parallels Desktop is complaining that the installation is incomplete.
        Try to reinstall Parallels Desktop or contact Parallels support.
      parallels_invalid_version: |-
        Vagrant has detected that you have a version of Parallels Desktop installed
        that is not supported. Please install or upgrade to one of the supported
        versions listed below to use Vagrant:

        %{supported_versions}
      parallels_no_room_for_high_level_network: |-
        There is no available slots on the Parallels Desktop VM for the configured
        high-level network interfaces. "private_network" and "public_network"
        network configurations consume a single network adapter slot on the
        Parallels Desktop VM. Parallels Desktop limits the number of slots to 8, and it
        appears that every slot is in use. Please lower the number of used
        network adapters.
      parallels_not_detected: |-
        Vagrant could not detect Parallels Desktop! Make sure it is properly installed.
        Vagrant uses the `prlctl` binary that ships with Parallels Desktop, and requires
        this to be available on the PATH. If Parallels Desktop is installed, please find
        the `prlctl` binary and add it to the PATH environmental variable.
      parallels_tools_iso_not_found: |-
        Parallels Tools ISO file does not exists. The Parallels provider uses it
        to install or update Parallels Tools in the guest machine. Try to
        reinstall Parallels Desktop.

        Expected ISO path: "%{iso_path}"
      parallels_tpl_name_not_found: |-
        The VM import failed! Template name not found. Please verify that
        the box you're using is not corrupted and try again.

      parallels_vm_option_not_found: |-
        Could not find a required option of Parallels Desktop virtual machine:
          %{vm_option}
        This is an internal error that should be reported as a bug.
      vm_import_failure: |-
        The VM import failed! Please verify that the box you're using is not
        corrupted and try again.

      vm_name_exists: |-
        Parallels Desktop virtual machine with the name '%{name}' already exists.
        Please use another name or delete the machine with the existing
        name, and try again.

          Parallels Desktop VM is already running.
      status:
        inaccessible: |-
          The VM is inaccessible! This is a rare case which means that Parallels
          Desktop can't find your VM configuration. This usually happens when deleting
          the VM via Parallels Desktop GUI, moving to a new computer, etc.
          Please consult Vagrant Parallels provider for how to handle this issue.
        not_created: |-
          The environment has not yet been created. Run `vagrant up` to
          create the environment. If a machine is not created, only the
          default provider will be shown. So if a provider is not listed,
          then the machine is not created for that environment.
        suspended: |-
          The VM is suspended. To resume this VM you can run `vagrant resume`
          or `vagrant up` to restart it again, so that vagrant would be able
          to control the VM again.
        stopped: |-
          The VM is stopped. To start the VM, simply run `vagrant up`
        running: |-
          The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
          shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
          suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
          simply run `vagrant up`.

            Parallels Tools were not detected on this VM! They are required
            for forwarded ports, shared folders, host only networking and more.
            If SSH fails or shared folders are not working on this machine,
            please install Parallels Tools within the virtual machine and
            reload your VM.

            Parallels Tools have been installed. Rebooting the VM...

            Parallels Tools installed on this VM are outdated! In most cases
            this is fine but in rare cases it can cause things such as shared
            folders to not work properly. If you see shared folder errors,
            please update Parallels Tools within the virtual machine and 
            reload your VM.
